# Hotel Booking Demand: Analysis & Forecasting using SQL and Python

üìå Understanding hotel booking demand and price fluctuations is essential for optimizing revenue and enhancing customer satisfaction. This project provides a comprehensive analysis of hotel booking trends and pricing strategies using a combination of data processing, exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and SQL-based insights. By identifying key factors that influence demand, cancellations, and pricing, we offer actionable recommendations to maximize profitability and improve decision-making.

üîç This project is structured into two key sections: **Time Series Analysis & Forecasting** and **SQL-Based Analysis**, covering various aspects of hotel booking demand and price forecasting.

## üìä Time Series Analysis & Forecasting

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

    Executed a rigorous data preprocessing pipeline to ensure dataset integrity and reliability. This included handling missing data using appropriate imputation techniques to maintain dataset completeness, ensuring proper formatting and consistency across all variables, and detecting and addressing outliers that could skew analysis and affect model performance.

- **Inserting Processed Data into Database**

    Employed a structured approach to store and manage the processed dataset within PostgreSQL, ensuring optimal query performance for SQL-based analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

    Conducted statistical diagnostics, including univariate and bivariate analysis, to understand feature distributions and interdependencies. Performed time series decomposition to analyze temporal fluctuations in key variables. Examined critical booking patterns such as lead times, seasonality effects, cancellation behaviors, and customer segmentation. Extracted actionable insights at each stage, aligning data-driven observations with business strategy.

- **Price Forecasting & Prediction**

    Built predictive analytics models to forecast pricing dynamics based on complex demand-influencing variables. To enhance predictive power and generalizability, engineered both time-series and non-time-series features while optimizing model performance.
        

## üìä SQL-Based Analysis

SQL-based analysis was conducted across four key dimensions: Booking Trends & Patterns Over Time, Revenue & ADR Analysis, Cancellation Behavior, and Customer Preferences & Special Requests.

- Booking Trends & Patterns over Time: Identified seasonal patterns, peak demand periods, and customer booking behaviors.
- Revenue & ADR Analysis: Evaluated revenue streams and pricing trends to identify opportunities for optimization.
- Cancellation Behavior: Investigated factors affecting cancellations and their impact on business performance.
- Customer Preferences & Special Requests: Analyzed guest preferences and special requests to improve service offerings.
- Business Recommendations & Strategic Actions: Suggested improvements in pricing strategies, customer retention efforts, and operational efficiency and identified data-driven opportunities to enhance revenue and minimize losses.

This end-to-end analysis equips hotels with valuable insights to refine pricing models, improve customer satisfaction, and maximize revenue. üöÄ


## üìä Data

The dataset used in this project comprises booking records from multiple hotels in Portugal and is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand/data?select=hotel_bookings.csv). It includes comprehensive details on bookings, cancellations, and pricing, offering a robust foundation for in-depth analysis and forecasting of these critical aspects.


## üìå Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- PostgreSQL
- Kaggle API


## üì• Installing Dependencies

To install the required Python libraries for this project, create a virtual environment and use the `requirements.txt` file:

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies for this project:

```bash
python -m venv booking-env
```

### Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment

**On Windows:**
```bash
.\booking-env\Scripts\activate
```

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
source booking-env/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Use the requirements.txt file to install all the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install the necessary libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.


## üîë Storing Credentials Securely (config.py)

To keep your credentials secure, make sure to store them in a `config.py` file. Here's how:

1. Create a new file named `config.py` in the root directory.
2. Store sensitive information (such as database credentials, API keys, etc.) in this file:

```python
# config.py

DB_HOST = "your_host"
DB_PORT = "your_port"
DB_NAME = "your_database_name"
DB_USER = "your_username"
DB_PASSWORD = "your_password"

KAGGLE_API_KEY = "your_kaggle_api_key"
```

## üîß Setting Up the Database

Open `notebooks/Data_Cleaning_and_Preparation.ipynb` and run all the cells to:

- Preprocess the data.
- Create the PostgreSQL database.
- Load the preprocessed data into the database.

üìù **NOTE:** The file "cleaned_and_prepared_data.csv" is included in the root directory, containing the fully processed and ready-for-analysis dataset.


## üí° üß† Key Insights & Business Actions

Throughout the analysis, several crucial insights were extracted, which can guide decision-making and strategic planning for hotel management. Here are some of the key findings:

Booking Trends & Seasonality: The analysis revealed strong seasonal variations in bookings, with peak demand during holiday seasons and specific local events. Understanding these patterns and their anomalies allows for more efficient resource allocation and optimized pricing strategies.

Cancellation Behavior: A high cancellation rate was observed, particularly with long lead times. This indicates an opportunity to implement stricter cancellation policies or offer incentives for customers to honor their bookings, thus reducing potential revenue loss.

Revenue Optimization: The Average Daily Rate (ADR) showed a clear relationship with demand fluctuations, suggesting that dynamic pricing models could significantly improve revenue. By forecasting ADR and integrating demand factors, hotels can adjust their prices to maximize profitability.

Customer Preferences & Special Requests: Analysis of customer preferences revealed that certain room types and additional services are in higher demand. Hotels can use this data to tailor their offerings, improving customer satisfaction and increasing upsell opportunities.

**üí° Business Actions:**

- Implement dynamic pricing strategies based on seasonal and demand-driven factors.
- Optimize booking policies to reduce cancellations and enhance revenue certainty.
- Develop targeted marketing strategies that focus on the most popular customer preferences and special requests.
- Leverage data-driven insights to refine hotel operations and ensure a better customer experience.

By integrating these insights into day-to-day operations, hotels can improve profitability, customer retention, and operational efficiency
