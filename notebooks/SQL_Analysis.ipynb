    "Understanding hotel booking data is crucial for optimizing revenue, improving customer retention, and enhancing operational efficiency. By analyzing key factors such as demand patterns, revenue trends, cancellation behavior, and guest preferences, hotels can make data-driven decisions to maximize profitability and guest satisfaction. For instance, identifying seasonality trends helps in dynamic pricing, while analyzing cancellation patterns allows for better overbooking strategies. Insights into customer preferences also enable hotels to tailor their services, ultimately improving guest experiences and increasing repeat bookings.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore these aspects comprehensively, we will analyze the data from four key perspectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Booking Trends & Demand Analysis – Examining seasonality, lead times, and occupancy trends to understand peak periods and demand fluctuations.\n",
    "- Revenue & Average Daily Rate (ADR) Analysis – Evaluating revenue generation, ADR patterns, and their relationship with different customer segments.\n",
    "- Cancellation Behavior & Customer Retention – Investigating cancellation trends, their impact on revenue, and factors influencing customer loyalty.\n",
    "- Customer Preferences & Special Requests – Analyzing room type preferences, special requests, and their correlation with guest satisfaction and repeat bookings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured analysis will provide actionable insights for revenue management, customer segmentation, and overall business strategy."

    "The data shows a clear seasonal pattern in monthly bookings, with the highest number of bookings occurring in August (11,104) and gradually decreasing towards the start of the year, where January sees the lowest number (4,607). There is a noticeable peak during the summer months, particularly in July and August, suggesting that this period is a popular time for bookings. Following this, the number of bookings consistently declines through the fall and into winter, with a significant drop observed from August to December. This could indicate that demand for bookings tends to be lower in the colder months, possibly due to reduced travel or leisure activities during the winter season."

    "\n",
    "- The Year-over-Year (YOY) values for 2015 are NaN because there is no data for the previous year (2014). This is expected behavior, as there is no \"last year\" data to compare it with.\n",
    "\n",
    "- YOY for 2016 and 2017: The YOY values are calculated where there is data for the same month in the previous year. The values indicate the percentage change in the count of arrivals compared to the same month in the prior year. For example: 2016 August (4381) compared to 2015 August (2437) results in a YOY of 79.77%.\n",

    "\n",
    "In 2017, there are fewer YOY increases compared to 2016, such as in August (-2.17%) and March (-4.75%), which could indicate a slight decrease in overall demand or changes in external factors that affected arrivals. The YOY for May across years shows a positive trend (e.g., 22.13% for 2017 vs. 2016), suggesting a steady increase in arrivals during this month.\n",

    "**Insights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Strong growth in 2016 compared to 2015: The arrivals in 2016 seem to have significantly increased in many months compared to 2015, with large YOY increases, such as 79.77% in August and 129.30% in July.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some months have decreasing trends in 2017: In 2017, months like August and March show a slight decline compared to the previous year, with YOY values of -2.17% and -4.75%.\n",

    "The average stay duration fluctuates across months and years, with August 2015 having the longest stay duration at 4.28 nights. In general, stay durations tend to be slightly shorter at the beginning of each year, with January 2016 showing the lowest at 2.68 nights. The highest stay durations in 2017 were seen in August (4.16 nights) and July (4.07 nights). This suggests that guests may extend their stays during the summer months, possibly due to vacation or holiday periods."

    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Seasonality and Booking Trends: \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset reveals clear seasonal patterns in demand, with bookings peaking in the summer months (particularly in July and August), followed by a significant decline during the winter months. These seasonal shifts suggest that the market is highly sensitive to external factors, such as weather, holidays, and travel preferences, which drive the bulk of demand during warmer months. The steep drop from August to December suggests that winter months see lower demand, likely due to reduced leisure travel and fewer vacation opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Impact of Market Segments and Booking Channels: \n",
    "\n",
    "A clear shift towards Online Travel Agents (OTA) is observed, which consistently shows an increase in bookings across years. This reflects the growing importance of digital channels in customer decision-making and booking behavior. In contrast, segments such as Offline TA/TO and Direct bookings have seen slower growth, indicating that customers are increasingly leveraging online platforms for better deals, flexibility, and convenience. This shift highlights the need for strong online marketing strategies and partnerships with OTAs to capture a larger share of the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Bookings and Cancellation Trends: \n",
    "\n",
    "While overall bookings have grown over time, a noticeable increase in cancellation rates in 2017, particularly in peak months like May, suggests that customer behavior is changing. The cancellation rate in May 2017 peaked at 36.93%, the highest recorded, indicating that customers are becoming more comfortable with canceling their reservations or perhaps taking advantage of flexible cancellation policies. This trend could be influenced by factors such as economic uncertainty, external events, or a shift in customer expectations around booking flexibility. This trend warrants further investigation to understand its full impact and identify potential causes, such as market competition, economic downturns, or changes in customer preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Weekend vs. Weekday Stay Distribution: \n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of weekday vs. weekend stays reveals a balanced distribution, with a slight dominance of weekday bookings over weekends. This consistent pattern throughout the years suggests that guests are booking stays fairly evenly across both weekdays and weekends. The similarity between the two types of stays also implies that guests are not highly dependent on weekends for their stays, and businesses could leverage this pattern by targeting guests across both types of bookings. Given the similar number of weekday and weekend stays, a flexible pricing strategy that adjusts based on the demand during these periods could maximize revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Stay Duration Trends: \n",
    "\n",
    "The average stay duration fluctuates over the course of the year, with the longest stays typically seen during the summer months. This suggests that longer stays correlate with vacation periods or holiday travel, while shorter stays are more common during the start of the year when travel activity is relatively low. This pattern provides insights into customer preferences, where vacationers tend to extend their stays in peak seasons, whereas business travelers or weekend getaways may prefer shorter stays. Understanding these trends can help hotels optimize their pricing strategies and package deals to appeal to customers during peak seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Lead Time Trends: \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a noticeable trend toward longer booking lead times as peak seasons approach. For example, the summer months of July and August show increased lead times, possibly due to higher demand during these periods. This indicates a shift towards more advanced planning for popular travel months, which could be attributed to a combination of higher demand and customers securing reservations earlier to avoid price hikes or availability issues. Hotels could take advantage of this trend by offering early-bird promotions or discounts for advanced bookings to capture more guests early on."

    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Seasonality and Demand Fluctuations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Peak Pricing: The highest ADRs occur during the summer months, specifically in August and July, where prices are elevated to capitalize on peak tourism demand. In August 2017, ADR peaked at 149.98 dollars, while July 2017 followed closely with 135.28 dollars. This supports the assumption that these months are associated with high-demand periods, likely due to vacationers and tourists seeking accommodation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Off-Peak Pricing: Conversely, the winter months, such as January and November, show the lowest ADRs (e.g., 70.18 dollars in January 2017), suggesting that demand significantly drops during the off-season. This lower pricing is a strategic approach to attract guests during slower periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Long-Term ADR Growth:\n",
    "\n",
    "ADR has been consistently rising year over year, with 2017 showing the most significant increase. For instance, August 2017 saw an increase from 123.15 dollars (2015) to 166.94 dollars (2017), marking an upward trajectory. This suggests that the overall market demand has grown, possibly due to increased tourism, improved marketing, or even inflationary pressures.\n",
    "The 9.89% increase from 2015 to 2016 and 16.8% growth from 2016 to 2017 further indicate that hotels are successfully capitalizing on increased demand, enhancing their pricing strategies over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Market Segments and Revenue Opportunities:\n",
    "\n",
    "Online Travel Agencies (OTA) and Direct bookings are the most profitable channels, with higher ADRs of 118 dollars compared to Corporate and Group bookings at 68.31 dollars and 75.10 dollars, respectively. This suggests that last-minute bookings and premium flexibility in OTA and direct bookings result in higher prices, potentially due to the willingness of customers to pay for convenience and certainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Corporate and Group bookings at lower ADRs might indicate that these segments benefit from bulk discounts or negotiated rates, which are common in the business and group travel sectors. Targeting individual leisure travelers could present an opportunity for premium pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Room Type Analysis shows that Room Type A generates the highest revenue (5.18M dollars), significantly outperforming other types. This could be due to higher demand, premium pricing, or better availability. Room type E, in contrast, generated only 755K dollars, suggesting either limited availability, lower customer interest, or possibly suboptimal marketing or positioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Geographical Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "Portugal (PRT), United Kingdom (GBR), and France (FRA) emerge as key contributors to overall revenue, with Portugal particularly standing out due to its domestic tourism and a strong local customer base. Marketing campaigns targeting these regions could leverage localized strategies and loyalty programs to foster repeat business.\n",
    "United Kingdom (GBR) stands out due to strong historical ties, ease of travel, and high-spending British tourists. Targeting promotions during peak seasons could effectively capture this market's attention.\n",
    "France (FRA), with its steady inbound tourism, presents an opportunity to introduce tailored services (e.g., French-language services, travel packages) to increase engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Cancellation Impact:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lost revenue due to cancellations and no-shows represents nearly 30% of potential earnings (2.79M dollars). Addressing this issue through better booking policies, stricter cancellation terms, or targeted rebooking campaigns could help recover a significant portion of this lost revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Lead Time and Pricing Sensitivity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Longer lead times correlate with lower ADRs. Bookings made more than a year in advance tend to command lower prices (82.53 dollars), suggesting that price-sensitive customers book early to secure lower rates. In contrast, bookings made within 3-6 months command higher ADRs (113.83 dollars), indicating that customers booking closer to their stay are willing to pay higher rates for last-minute flexibility."

    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Overall Cancellation Rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "The high cancellation rate of 27.5% is an alarming indicator that demands urgent attention. The data suggests a notable discrepancy between the booking behavior and cancellation patterns across different customer segments, booking lead times, and booking conditions. Addressing cancellations is critical not only for improving revenue but also for optimizing customer retention strategies and refining pricing models.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Longer Lead Times and Cancellations: \n",
    "\n",
    "Longer lead times (6-12 months and 1+ years) are associated with higher cancellation rates. This could indicate that guests who book well in advance are more likely to change their plans or experience uncertainty in their schedules. For example, travelers may face shifting work schedules, changes in family plans, or unforeseen events that lead to cancellations. This trend also points to a potential mismatch between customer booking patterns and the stability of their travel plans, which may lead to higher uncertainty for businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Shorter Lead Times and Committed Guests: \n",
    "\n",
    "Shorter lead times (0-7 days) show significantly lower cancellation rates, suggesting that guests who book closer to their stay are more committed to their travel plans. These last-minute bookers are typically more certain about their trips and less likely to cancel. The higher commitment level of these guests could be leveraged to introduce higher pricing or premium services, as these customers are likely willing to pay a premium for flexibility and convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Online Travel Agencies (OTA) and Last-Minute Cancellations: \n",
    "\n",
    "The Online Travel Agency (OTA) segment has the highest cancellation rate (35.4%), which is notably higher than other booking channels. This indicates that OTA customers may be more price-sensitive or less loyal, likely driven by booking flexibility and lower prices, which are prominent features of these platforms. The lack of strong brand loyalty among OTA customers could make them more likely to cancel when a better deal or an alternative option becomes available, especially as the stay date approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Customer Loyalty and Retention: \n",
    "\n",
    "Only 4.18% of total guests are repeat customers, revealing a high turnover rate and emphasizing the challenge of retaining existing clients. This low repeat guest rate signifies that current customer retention strategies are underperforming and that the hospitality business might be overly reliant on attracting new customers rather than cultivating loyalty. Moreover, the ADR for repeat guests is notably lower than for first-time guests ($6,511.19 vs. $10,803.69), which suggests that the repeat customer segment may benefit from discounts or incentives, while new customers tend to book higher-value rooms. This further highlights the need for targeted strategies that can raise the value of repeat guests and incentivize them to return more frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Non-Refundable Deposits and Their Effectiveness: \n",
    "\n",
    "The extremely high cancellation rate of 94.32% among guests who book non-refundable deposits raises concerns about the effectiveness of this policy. Despite the non-refundable nature of these bookings, cancellations remain exceedingly high, indicating that customers might cancel despite the financial penalties or may be unclear about the implications of such booking conditions. This raises the need for a review of non-refundable policies and perhaps a reconsideration of how these terms are communicated or enforced. Additionally, offering more flexible alternatives could reduce cancellations without significantly compromising revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Segmented Cancellation Behavior: \n",
    "\n",
    "Transient customers contribute the most to lost revenue, with the highest cancellation rate (33.1%). This indicates that transient customers, who likely book individually or for short-term stays, may be more prone to cancellations or no-shows. These customers are typically more price-sensitive, have less brand loyalty, and may prioritize flexibility, all of which increase the likelihood of cancellation. On the other hand, Group customers and Transient-Party customers exhibit much lower cancellation rates, suggesting that groups and pre-arranged parties are more reliable. Their lower cancellation rates present an opportunity to focus on group bookings or parties to minimize cancellations and maximize revenue predictability."

    "\n",
    "Room type \"A\" sees the highest number of reservations, indicating a strong preference for this type of room among guests. This preference could be influenced by factors such as location, amenities, or price. Conversely, room types \"D\" and \"E\" have significantly fewer bookings, pointing to a potential mismatch between guest preferences and room availability. This suggests that room types \"D\" and \"E\" might not align with customer needs or desires, possibly due to suboptimal marketing, less desirable room features, or pricing issues. Understanding the reasons behind these preferences can help optimize inventory management and guide targeted promotions to boost bookings for less popular room types.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Mismatch Between Reserved and Assigned Rooms: \n",
    "\n",
    "The 14.89% mismatch rate between reserved and assigned rooms is a crucial issue for customer satisfaction. When a guest’s requested room type is not available upon arrival, it can lead to dissatisfaction, complaints, or even cancellations. This highlights a need for more precise room allocation processes, potentially involving better forecasting tools, improved communication between booking systems and the front desk, or more flexible room assignment protocols. Ensuring that guests receive the room type they reserved will likely improve guest satisfaction and reduce cancellation rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Special Requests and Booking Commitments: \n",
    "\n",
    "The downward trend in the cancellation rate as the number of special requests increases is a noteworthy finding. Guests who make special requests are less likely to cancel their reservations, suggesting that special requests are indicative of stronger commitment and intention to show up. These requests could range from room preferences to specific amenities or services. The correlation between special requests and reduced cancellations implies that guests who have taken the time to make specific demands are more invested in their stays. This could be leveraged as a signal for higher booking certainty, which can inform both customer service and booking strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Special Requests by Repeat and Non-Repeat Guests: \n",
    "\n",
    "While non-repeat guests submit a significantly higher total number of special requests (82,866 vs. 3,616), the rate of special requests per reservation is quite similar across both repeat (0.68 requests per reservation) and non-repeat guests (0.70 requests per reservation). This indicates that the nature of special requests does not differ substantially between first-time and repeat guests, even though the total number of requests from non-repeat guests is much higher. Non-repeat guests might be more likely to book in larger numbers or through channels with higher volumes of transient bookings (e.g., OTAs), which could explain the higher overall count. For repeat guests, the similar rate of requests per booking implies that their preferences and needs remain relatively consistent with their past stays, underscoring the importance of remembering and catering to individual preferences for return visits."

    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">**Maximize Online Presence**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the dominance of OTAs, strengthening partnerships with these platforms while enhancing direct online booking channels will ensure higher visibility and attract a larger pool of potential guests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategic Action: Focus on digital marketing campaigns, optimize booking platforms for ease of use, and offer incentives for direct bookings, such as discounts or exclusive benefits. \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">**Address Cancellations**\n",
    "\n",
    "The increasing trend of cancellations is impacting occupancy rates and revenue. To address this, refining cancellation policies is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategic Action: Consider implementing non-refundable booking options, offering flexible cancellation alternatives (e.g., partial refunds for earlier cancellations), and using customer behavior analysis to anticipate cancellations. Additionally, introduce last-minute offers to fill rooms at premium rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">**Target Seasonal Demand**\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonality is a key factor in demand fluctuations. Strategic planning for peak and off-peak months can help smoothen revenue streams throughout the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategic Action: Create seasonal packages, special promotions, and loyalty offers for peak periods (e.g., summer months) and targeted campaigns with discounts during off-peak seasons (e.g., fall and winter).\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">**Optimize Weekend & Weekday Pricing**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is potential to capitalize on both weekend and weekday bookings through tailored pricing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategic Action: Implement dynamic pricing with special weekend promotions to attract more weekend guests, while offering weekday deals to fill vacancies and maintain occupancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">**Promote Extended Stays During Peak Seasons**\n",
    "\n",
    "Longer stays are more common during peak seasons, indicating an opportunity to further attract customers with longer vacation needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategic Action: Offer discounted rates or special packages for extended stays during the peak months to boost revenue during these high-demand periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">**Leverage Booking Lead Times**\n",
    "\n",
    "The trend of longer booking lead times provides an opportunity to secure advance bookings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategic Action: Create early booking promotions to incentivize guests to book in advance, ensuring higher occupancy during peak periods and securing revenue early.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">**Dynamic Pricing Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pricing flexibility is essential for optimizing revenue during both peak and off-peak periods.\n",

    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">**Optimize Room Type Revenue**\n",
    "\n",
    "Room types like \"A\" are in high demand, while others (e.g., \"E\") are underperforming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategic Action: Prioritize popular room types, investigate underperforming rooms, and improve marketing, pricing, or amenities for those room types. Consider introducing premium options for high-demand rooms during peak seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">**Geographic Focus and Targeting**\n",
    "\n",
    "Different regions may have unique customer preferences and behaviors.\n",

    "Strategic Action: Develop targeted marketing campaigns for key geographic markets (e.g., Portugal, UK, France), incorporating language preferences and cultural relevance to better engage potential customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">**Enhance Customer Retention through Loyalty Programs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat guests tend to generate higher ADRs, so enhancing retention is essential for long-term revenue growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategic Action: Develop or enhance loyalty programs offering repeat guests benefits such as discounts, room upgrades, or exclusive offers, which could boost their likelihood of booking again and improve customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">**Maximize Group and Party Bookings**\n",

    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">**Improve Room Inventory Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "Room type demand does not align perfectly with available inventory, particularly for less popular room types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategic Action: Align room inventory more effectively with demand, particularly for room type \"A.\" Investigate the reasons behind low demand for other room types and adjust their pricing, marketing, or amenities to increase their appeal.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">**Improve Room Allocation Processes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Room mismatches between reservations and assignments could lead to customer dissatisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategic Action: Enhance room allocation accuracy by implementing real-time room tracking systems and automating assignments. Ensure that guests are assigned the room they reserved to improve satisfaction and reduce cancellations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">**Leverage Special Requests for Customer Retention**\n",
    "\n",
    "Special requests correlate with reduced cancellations, indicating that they can be used to strengthen guest loyalty.\n",
    "\n",
